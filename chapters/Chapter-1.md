## 🥱 Sleep

To achieve optimal health and **productivity**, it is essential to prioritize **quality sleep** every night. Aim for at least *7 hours* of uninterrupted sleep. **Allah** has created the night as a time for rest, and **sleep** is a vital part of it.  

> **Allah says:** "He is the One Who has made the night for you as a cover, and ˹made˺ sleep for resting, and the day for rising."
>  25:47 

### 🔥 Scientific Benefits of Quality Sleep  

- Enhances cognitive function, allowing better decision-making and problem-solving.  
- Boosts productivity and energy levels throughout the day.  
- Improves memory retention by consolidating information learned during the day, transferring it from short-term to long-term memory.  
- The brain's functionality during the day significantly depends on the quality of sleep you get at night.  
- Remember, **quality > quantity**: *When you sleep and wake up matters more than the total number of hours you sleep.*  

### 🌟 Sleep Routine of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)

> [!NOTE]
> The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) followed a balanced and disciplined sleep routine, offering us an excellent example to achieve both spiritual and physical well-being:  

1. **Sleeping Early**  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) would sleep early after the *Isha* prayer, ensuring sufficient rest for the body and mind.  

2. **Waking Up for Tahajjud 🌙**  
   - He (ﷺ) would wake up in the last part of the night to pray *Tahajjud*, utilizing this time for personal worship and reflection.  

3. **Recitation Before Sleep 📖**  
   - Before sleeping, the Prophet (ﷺ) would recite:  
     - **Ayatul Kursi**  
     - **Surah Ikhlas, Falaq, and Nas** (3 times) and blow into his hands, wiping them over his body for protection.  

4. **Sleeping Position**  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) would sleep on his **right side**, placing his right hand under his cheek, which is a Sunnah and considered beneficial for **digestion** and **heart health**.  

5. **Dua Before Sleeping**  
   - He (ﷺ) would recite:  
     *“Allahumma bismika amutu wa ahya”*  
     *(O Allah, in Your name I die and I live)* as a reminder of entrusting one’s life to Allah.  

6. **Waking with Gratitude**  
   - Upon waking, the Prophet (ﷺ) would praise Allah with the following dua:  (📣 Read In Arabic From Online to Recite Correctly)
     *“Alhamdulillahil-ladhi ahyana ba’da ma amatana wa ilaihi-n-nushoor”*  
     *(Praise be to Allah, who gave us life after causing us to die, and to Him is the resurrection.)*  

By adopting these practices, you can develop a sleep routine that fosters physical rejuvenation, spiritual connection, and overall productivity.  

### 🌃 Strategies to Take Quality Sleep Every Night  

1. **Sleep Early 🛌**  
   - Aim to sleep early, around **10–11 PM**, depending on the sunset and sunrise times during the current season.  

2. **Time Your Meals 🍴**  
   - Eat your last meal at least 3 hours before bedtime. Avoid heavy meals within 2–3 hours of sleeping to improve digestion and sleep quality.  

3. **Limit Liquids Before Bed 🚰**  
   - Stop drinking liquids 2 hours before sleeping. This reduces the chances of waking up for bathroom trips, preventing sleep disruptions.  

4. **Reduce Screen Time Before Bed 📱**  
   - Avoid digital devices (phone, computer, TV) at least 1 hour before bed. The blue light emitted by these screens ***suppresses melatonin***, the sleep hormone, making it harder to fall asleep.  
     - **Example**: If you plan to sleep at 10 PM, stop using devices by 9 PM. Instead, engage in calming activities like reading a book or self-reflection to *wind down*.  

5. **Create a Dark Sleep Environment 🌑**  
   - Ensure your room is completely dark. Darkness signals your body that it’s time to rest, helping you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.  

6. **Incorporate Spiritual Activities Before Sleep 🕌**  
   - Practice these Sunnah-based spiritual activities to prepare your mind and soul for restful sleep:  
     1. **Repent for sins** committed during the day and ask for Allah’s forgiveness. 🙏  
     2. **Forgive others** who may have wronged you.  
     3. Recite **Ayatul Kursi** (*1 time*).  
     4. Recite **Surah Ikhlas, Falaq, and Nas** (*3 times each*), blow on your hands, and wipe them over your body.  
	     1. **Example:** Recite >> (Ikhlas, falaq, nas) then: *blow on your hands, and wipe them over your body* (do this process again for 2 times)
	 5. Recite: Last 2 verses of Sura Al-bakara
     6. Recite: (📣 Read Arabic for correct pronunciation) *“Allahumma bismika amutu wa ahya”* (O Allah, in Your name I die and I live).  
 6. **Note:** Follow a fixed sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day.

> [!NOTE]
> By consistently following these strategies, you’ll not only improve your sleep quality but also align your rest with both spiritual and physical well-being.

## ☀️ Woke up

## 🌅 Strategies to Wake Up Early in the Morning for Fajr

1. **Sleep Early and Prioritize Quality Sleep**  📌
   - Ensure you go to bed early and get at least 7 hours of quality sleep. A well-rested body and mind make it easier to wake up for Fajr.  

2. **Set an Alarm for Fajr ⏰**  
   - Use an alarm to ensure you wake up on time. Choose a tone that is effective but not harsh. 
	   - You can find cool alarm tones on [Zedge](https://www.zedge.net/).

> [!NOTE] 🚨 **Important**  
> You might have experienced waking up when your alarm rings, only to hit the snooze button without leaving your bed 🛏️!  
> 
> To fully **wake up**, I follow two effective methods mentioned below 👇:  

1. **📷 QR Alarm:**  
   I'm using an app called **Alarmy** ([Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=droom.sleepIfUCan)).  
   This app allows you to set an alarm with a unique stop mission, and one interesting mission is **QR Code Scanning**. 😱

2. **How to use it:**  
   - Create a **QR Code** (you can generate one online), print it, and place it on the wall or outside your room door.  
   - Set an alarm in Alarmy and select **QR Code Scan** as the mission. Scan your QR Code to link it.  
   - When your alarm rings, you'll need to leave your bed to stop it by scanning the QR Code. Without the code, you can't turn off or reduce the sound.  
   - (In special cases, you can use the app’s **Emergency Mode** if scanning isn't possible.)  

3. **Why it works:**  
   - This method forces you to physically get out of bed to stop the alarm.  
   - Once you're up, resist the temptation to return to bed—begin your **Fajr preparations** instead! 😊

2. 🚨  *Keep Your Phone Away from Your Bed 📱*
   - Place your phone or alarm device at a distance, such as on a chair in the middle of the room.  
   - This forces you to physically get out of bed to turn it off.  
     - **Example**: If your phone is on a chair across the room, the alarm will require you to take a short walk to silence it. This simple act helps train your brain 🧠 to associate the alarm with getting out of bed.  
   - Once you’re up, resist the urge to return to bed—start your Fajr preparations instead. 😊  

By implementing these strategies consistently, waking up for Fajr will become a habit that aligns with both your spiritual and productive goals.  

> [!TIP] 🌙 **Transform Your Life with Tahajjud**  
> Aim to wake up **30-40 minutes before Fajr** and dedicate some time to **Tahajjud prayer**.  

**Why Tahajjud is life-changing:**  
1. **Spiritual Growth:** It strengthens your connection with Allah and brings tranquility to your heart.  
2. **Answered Prayers:** The last third of the night is a blessed time when duas are more likely to be accepted.  
3. **Focus & Clarity:** Starting your day with worship brings mental clarity and focus, setting a productive tone for the rest of the day.  

Make it a habit, and you’ll witness the transformative impact it has on your life, both spiritually and mentally!

## ✅ Todos After Waking Up  

> Follow the activities below to boost your productivity, mood, and spiritual growth.  👇

2. **Drink Water 💧**

   - Cleanse yourself and get ready to connect with Allah through the Fajr prayer.  

4. **Go to the Masjid (For Men)**
