# Chapter 2: (Islamic Tips)

## 🚩 Special Tips  

1. **Create Rukya Water Every Night 💧**  
   - Drink only from Rukya water bottles. If possible, prepare multiple bottles 🍾; otherwise, use one and make fresh Rukya water nightly before sleep or anytime.

2. **Greet Others with Salam & Musafaha 🤝**  
   - When meeting new people, always start with *Assalamu Alaikum* and a handshake (*Musafaha*).  

3. **Secrets to Completing 5 Salah on Time 🕋**  
   - **Stay in Wudu (Ablution):**  
     - Keeping yourself in a state of wudu eliminates laziness when the time for salah comes.  
     - Often, it's not the prayer that feels daunting; it's the wudu. Many people, myself included, have experienced this realization.  
4. **Avoid Music, Drama, and Movies 📽️:**  
     - Replace them with Islamic series to reduce addiction.  
     - **Create a Reward System:** For example, "If I complete my studies, I will watch 1 episode of *Kurulus Osman* or *Ertugrul Ghazi*."  

5. **Engage in Tahajjud Prayer 🌙**  
   - **Struggle with Waking Up at Night? Try This:**  
     - After *Isha Salah*, do not complete the *Witr Salah* yet.  
     - Before sleeping, pray at least 2 rakahs for *Tahajjud* and then 3 rakahs for *Witr Salah*.  
     - **Alternative:** While it’s best to wake up in the middle of the night, this method allows you to gain benefits of *Tahajjud*.  
   - **Benefits of Tahajjud:** It strengthens your relationship with Allah, improves focus, and brings peace into your life.  

6. **Practice the 5-Minute Rule to Overcome Procrastination 🕔**  
   - If you're avoiding a task due to laziness, commit to doing it for just 5 minutes. Once you start, you’ll find it easier to continue and often exceed 5 minutes.  

7. **Follow the Sunnah of Eating 🍽️**  
   - Divide your stomach into three parts:  
     1. One-third for food.  
     2. One-third for water.  
     3. One-third left empty.  
   - This practice of moderation is Sunnah, has scientific benefits, and *prevents the lethargy* that comes from overeating.
